###### [] Step Two: Basic Setup

Find the "Pravus Framework Tools" Folder

Then go to the "PravusFrame" folder and drag the "PravusFramework_Base" prefab in your weapon.

<br    />

**Heads Up!!!**

() Do not rename the base prefab. Or else Pravus Framework won't be able to recognise if it has support.

() Try not to put the base prefab outside the weapon's prefab. It won't work.

() Not recommended putting the base prefab inside the weapon model's prefab. Issues may occur.
